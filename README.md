# Real-Time Collaborative Note-Taking App

A system designed to facilitate collaborative note-taking and calendar management with friends, featuring real-time updates, user authentication, and integration with Google Calendar. It uses microservices architecture to provide a scalable and resilient environment for seamless user interactions and data synchronization.

### Setup and Deployment

In order to run the project you'll have to get all the docker images and then:
1. Run all the Docker Containers:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

2. Then access all the endpoints through the gataway on the port:
```
http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

3. Start by First! registering an account on the endpoint:
```
http://0.0.0.0:8000/auth/register
```
with the following body format:

```json
{
  "username": "grig",
  "password": "grig"
}
```

4. After you registered succesully and got your token you can use that token to access any other endpoint.

### Application Suitability
* **Scalability Requirements:** The app needs to handle high volumes of concurrent users, especially during peak times when multiple users might be editing notes, logging in, or syncing with external calendars. Microservices allow each component to be scaled independently based on its demand, ensuring that the entire system remains responsive under load.
* **Decoupled Development and Deployment:** The app has distinct functionalities such as user authentication, real-time note collaboration, and calendar integration. By separating these functions into microservices, 2 students can work on different features simultaneously without interfering with each other. This leads to faster development and more efficient updates.
* **Technology Diversity:** Microservices architecture enables using the best-suited technologies for each service. For instance, NodeJS with MongoDB is optimal for handling authentication processes, while Neo4j provides a flexible and efficient solution for real-time data interactions in the note-taking service. Using Java for the calendar integration ensures compatibility and robust API management.

**Example:** 
* **Google Docs:** Manages real-time collaboration by segmenting various services responsible for document editing, user permissions, and synchronization. The use of microservices allows Google Docs to handle multiple concurrent edits while maintaining document integrity and performance.

### Deployment and Scaling

The App will use Docker for deployment. Each microservice runs in its own container, managed by Docker Compose, which handles scaling and automatic restarts. Services like Authentication and Note-Taking are deployed with replicas to manage load and ensure reliability. Databases and a cache service are also containerized to optimize performance.
